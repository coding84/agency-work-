This project is for a Marketing Agency, who wants a codebase th follows accessibility standards, in order their site optimized for search engines. 

Created a new ReadMe for this project as I realised it was missing because I thought the one we were provided with meant to be used, obviously I thought this 2 weeks ago, now I have learned that its not, and get the chance to practise more git add, git commit, git push,  wauw I am discovering mistakes...I gues I am getting better,  lol
